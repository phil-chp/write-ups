# HackTheBox - Cyber Apocalypse

[< Go back](../../README.md)

Even though the event spanned over 5 days, I had a lot of work over this period so I only really got 1-2 hours where I just wanted to chill and do some easy challenges.

Nothing really stood out, some of the very easy where a joke, having the flag in plain text somewhere.

But one of the very easy caught my attention, I wanted to keep a write up of it as I'm not too experiences with SQLi's and it was a very good learning experience.
