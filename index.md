# Write-Ups

## Description

This repository contains write-ups for various CTFs I have participated in or just simple challenges/machines I've completed on various platforms.

My objective is not collect them all, but to keep track of very intersting/challenging machines from which I wan't to keep a trace of.

Unless otherwise stated, all flags present in every write-up will be hidden with the following attribute: `<redactedX>`, where X is the flag number in case there are multiple. This is to incite people to try the challenges themselves and not just copy-paste the flags.
