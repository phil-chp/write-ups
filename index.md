This repository contains write-ups for various CTFs, challenges, and machines I've done.

My objective is not collect them all, but to keep track of very intersting/challenging machines where I learned something interesting. This is more of an archive for me than a blog, but I might make blog posts at some point if I feel like it.

I'll try my best to obfuscate flags, you should try the challenges and not just copy-paste the flags.
