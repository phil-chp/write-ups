# TryHackMe

<a class="back-link" href="../">< Go back</a>

TryHackMe write-ups policies are pretty flexible, I will still try to obfuscate the flags.

Challenges I do write-ups are either very interesting or anything where I learned something useful that I want to keep a record of.

## Challenges

<!-- ### ðŸŸ£ Insane -->

### ðŸ”´ Hard

- [Advent of Cyber 2023 - Side Quest 1](./AoC2023-SQ1/)

<!-- ### ðŸŸ  Medium -->

### ðŸŸ¢ Easy

- [Cyborg](./Cyborg/)
